# 3D Upload Fix

## Issue Description
The 3D upload functionality was failing with a 404 error because the frontend was calling `/api/3Dproducts/upload` but this route didn't exist in the backend.

## Root Cause
- Frontend was calling `POST /api/3Dproducts/upload` with FormData
- Backend only had individual upload routes (`/uploadcolorfile`, `/uploadcolorimage`)
- Missing combined upload route for creating 3D products with files

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Missing Backend Route
**File**: `indardeco-main/routes/Product.js`
```javascript
router.post("/3Dproducts/upload", upload.any(["image3D", "imageCouleurs"]), async (req, res) => {
  // Handles combined 3D product creation with file uploads
});
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
**File**: `src/app/dash-adm/products/consult-product/upload-3d.component.ts`
- Added specific error messages for different HTTP status codes
- Better user feedback for common issues

### 3. File Validation
The route includes:
- File type validation for 3D files (.glb, .gltf)
- File size validation (50MB max for 3D, 10MB for images)
- Required field validation

## How the Fix Works

### Backend Route (`/3Dproducts/upload`)
1. **Receives FormData** with:
   - `prodId`: Product ID
   - `quantity`: Quantity
   - `image3D`: 3D file (.glb/.gltf)
   - `imageCouleurs`: Color image

2. **Validates Input**:
   - Checks for required fields
   - Validates file presence
   - Separates files by fieldname

3. **Uploads Files**:
   - Uploads 3D file to S3 (`3d_files/` folder)
   - Uploads color image to S3 (`color_images/` folder)

4. **Creates Product3D**:
   - Saves to database with file URLs
   - Returns success response

### Frontend Component
1. **File Selection**:
   - Validates file types and sizes
   - Shows progress during upload

2. **Form Submission**:
   - Creates FormData with all required fields
   - Shows upload progress
   - Handles errors gracefully

## Testing

### 1. Test the Backend Route
```bash
cd indardeco-main
node test3DUpload.js
```

### 2. Test the Frontend
1. Navigate to a product detail page
2. Click "Upload 3D Model"
3. Select a .glb/.gltf file for 3D model
4. Select an image file for color
5. Enter quantity
6. Submit the form

## Expected Results
- ✅ 3D upload should work without 404 errors
- ✅ Files should upload to S3 successfully
- ✅ Product3D should be created in database
- ✅ Progress bar should show upload progress
- ✅ Success message should appear after upload

## Error Handling
The component now provides specific error messages:
- **404**: "Route non trouvée. Vérifiez que le serveur backend est démarré."
- **401**: "Erreur d'authentification. Veuillez vous reconnecter."
- **400**: Shows specific validation error
- **500**: "Erreur serveur. Veuillez réessayer plus tard."

## File Requirements
### 3D Files
- **Types**: .glb, .gltf
- **Max Size**: 50MB
- **Field Name**: `image3D`

### Color Images
- **Types**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Max Size**: 10MB
- **Field Name**: `imageCouleurs`

## API Endpoints
### 3D Products
- `POST /api/3Dproducts/upload` - Create 3D product with files
- `POST /api/3Dproducts` - Create 3D product (data only)
- `GET /api/3Dproducts/:id` - Get 3D product by ID
- `GET /api/3Dproducts/all/:id` - Get all 3D products for a product

### File Uploads
- `PUT /api/uploadcolorfile` - Upload 3D file for existing product
- `PUT /api/uploadcolorimage` - Upload color image for existing product

## Next Steps
1. Test the 3D upload functionality
2. Verify files are uploaded to S3 correctly
3. Check that Product3D records are created in database
4. Test the 3D viewer with uploaded models
