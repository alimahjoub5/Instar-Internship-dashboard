## Database Models Used

### Core Models
- **User**: User registrations and profiles
- **Product**: Product catalog and details
- **Sales**: Sales transactions and revenue
- **Review**: Product reviews and ratings
- **Subscription**: Subscription management
- **Supplier**: Supplier information
- **Category**: Product categories
- **SubCategory**: Product subcategories

### Data Aggregation
The dashboard uses MongoDB aggregation pipelines to:
- Calculate totals and counts
- Group data by various criteria
- Sort and limit results
- Join data from multiple collections
- Calculate revenue and performance metrics

## Business Logic

### Growth Calculations
- User growth percentage (simplified calculation)
- Product growth percentage
- Sales growth percentage
- Revenue trend analysis

### Activity Tracking
- Real-time activity monitoring
- Multi-source activity aggregation
- Timestamp-based sorting
- Activity categorization

### Performance Metrics
- Top products by sales revenue
- Top suppliers by product count
- Revenue period analysis
- Order count tracking

## Error Handling

### Standard Error Response
```json
{
  "error": "Error message description"
}
```

### Common Error Scenarios
- Database connection issues
- Missing required fields
- Invalid query parameters
- Aggregation pipeline errors

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexing
- Ensure proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Use compound indexes for complex queries
- Index timestamp fields for date-based queries

### Query Optimization
- Limit result sets to prevent memory issues
- Use projection to select only needed fields
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Cache frequently accessed statistics

### Aggregation Optimization
- Use `$match` early in aggregation pipelines
- Limit intermediate result sets
- Use appropriate `$group` operations
- Sort results efficiently

## Security Considerations

### Data Access
- Implement proper authentication for dashboard access
- Validate user permissions for sensitive data
- Sanitize query parameters
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

### Data Privacy
- Ensure sensitive data is not exposed
- Implement proper data anonymization
- Follow GDPR compliance guidelines
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication

## Testing

### Test Script
Use the provided test script to verify all endpoints:
```bash
node testDashboardBackend.js
